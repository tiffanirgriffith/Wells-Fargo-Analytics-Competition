<p>I am a collector of undergraduate degrees. I have a BS in Marine Biology and now I'm back at College of Charleston for a BS in Mathematics with a cognate in statistics. When I'm not identifying fish, working with minitab or learning R you can find me spending time with my three dogs, cat, and chinchilla. </p>

<a id="competition-details" class="anchor" href="#competition-details" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Competition Details</h3>

<p>Wells Fargo invited College of Charleston along with 12 other universities to participation in a social media analytics competition. We were challenged to develop a repeatable process to understand the drivers from consumer financial conversations on twitter and Facebook.

<a id="our-methodology" class="anchor" href="#our-methodology" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Our Methodology</h3>

<p>Our approach was to examine the data and isolate terms which could be used to distinguish the general feelings towards each individual banks’ foreign/abroad transactions. Our methodology was to isolate each bank and then run a sentiment analysis for positive and negative words (provided by positive and negative lexicons) within posts containing the words foreign and abroad. We ran a sentiment analysis and interpreted the graphs and ratios. Below is a description and visual representation of our analytic process flow. </p>

<a id="analytic-process-flow" class="anchor" href="#analytic-process-flow" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Analytic Process Flow</h3>

<p>Our code reflects our analytical process flow in that we extracted the raw data and manually reviewed some banks for common topic. We then used R to clean the data. We removed punctuation, non-important words, numbers, etc. We also divided the data into bank specific data frames. We then ran sentiment analysis for negative and positive feelings towards foreign affairs and abroad transactions for each bank. We analyzed our data and tried to make inferences based on the negative to positive ratios. 
We noticed many topics; some keywords we found were withdrawn, overdrawn, customer service, and foreign/abroad transactions. We focused on the topics of foreign affairs and abroad transactions. The substances were determined for each bank based on their negative to positive ratios. Below are our graphs for the positive and negative sentiment analysis for each bank.

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/4bGuauq.gif" alt=""></p>

<p>Bank A had a positive/negative ratio of .88 
Bank B had a positive/negative ratio of .73
Bank C had a positive/negative ratio of .53
Bank D had a positive/negative ratio of .60</p>

<a id="conclusion" class="anchor" href="#conclusion" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Conclusion</h2>

<p>After analyzing the ratios from our sentiment we found that for the topics of foreign and abroad Bank C had the most negative posts. Bank B was a near second for most negative. We further investigated the data to determine the substances and found that customers were unhappy with bank cards not working abroad. We also found that many customers felt negatively towards foreign exchange fees, some claiming that Bank D and Bank C must be “rigging” the fee rates. Bank D had the a slightly less negative ratio than Banks B and C suggesting customers commenting about Bank D have fewer problems with foreign and abroad transaction. Bank A had the least negative sentiment, suggesting many customers were happy with their interactions with Bank A when concerning topics of foreign and abroad transactions. We don’t believe we can necessarily draw any definite inferences from the sentiment analysis as there is no clear evidence that the banks did in fact rig the foreign exchange fee rates, but we can see that it is an important factor that customers are associating with these banks. The use of cards abroad is also an important factor to these customers, and can be an issue that these banks may find worthwhile investigating further. </p>

<p>I took our code and expanded upon it to understand what words in general are most frequently being discussed. So I implemented a code that created a plot of word frequency and a word cloud. Below is the code:</p>
